## Module Description

This Puppet module manages the resource of Google Cloud Resource Manager.
You can manage its resources using standard Puppet DSL and the module will,
under the hood, ensure the state described will be reflected in the Google
Cloud Platform resources.

## Setup

To install this module on your Puppet Master (or Puppet Client/Agent), use the
Puppet module installer:

    puppet module install google-gresourcemanager

Optionally you can install support to _all_ Google Cloud Platform products at
once by installing our "bundle" [`google-cloud`][bundle-forge] module:

    puppet module install google-cloud

Since this module depends on the `googleauth` and `google-api-client` gems,
you will also need to install those, with

    /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install googleauth google-api-client

If you prefer, you could also add the following to your puppet manifest:

		package { [
				'googleauth',
				'google-api-client',
			]:
				ensure   => present,
				provider => puppet_gem,
		}

## Usage

### Credentials

All Google Cloud Platform modules use an unified authentication mechanism,
provided by the [`google-gauth`][] module. Don't worry, it is automatically
installed when you install this module.

```puppet
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
  ],
}
```

Please refer to the [`google-gauth`][] module for further requirements, i.e.
required gems.

## Development

### Automatically Generated Files

Some files in this package are automatically generated by
[Magic Modules][magic-modules].

We use a code compiler to produce this module in order to avoid repetitive tasks
and improve code quality. This means all Google Cloud Platform Puppet modules
use the same underlying authentication, logic, test generation, style checks,
etc.

Learn more about the way to change autogenerated files by reading the
[CONTRIBUTING.md][] file.

### Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md][] for more information on how to get
started.

### Running tests

This project contains tests for [rspec][], [rspec-puppet][] and [rubocop][] to
verify functionality. For detailed information on using these tools, please see
their respective documentation.

#### Testing quickstart: Ruby > 2.0.0

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rubocop
```

#### Debugging Tests

In case you need to debug tests in this module you can set the following
variables to increase verbose output:

Variable                | Side Effect
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`PUPPET_HTTP_VERBOSE=1` | Prints network access information by Puppet provier.
`PUPPET_HTTP_DEBUG=1`   | Prints the payload of network calls being made.
`GOOGLE_HTTP_VERBOSE=1` | Prints debug related to the network calls being made.
`GOOGLE_HTTP_DEBUG=1`   | Prints the payload of network calls being made.

During test runs (using [rspec][]) you can also set:

Variable                | Side Effect
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`RSPEC_DEBUG=1`         | Prints debug related to the tests being run.
`RSPEC_HTTP_VERBOSE=1`  | Prints network expectations and access.
